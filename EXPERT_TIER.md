# expert-tier — a llama.cpp fork for running huge MoE models on small VRAM

**What this is**: upstream llama.cpp offloads MoE weights to CPU *per layer*. This fork
adds **per-expert placement**: the few hundred experts a model actually fires most live in
a VRAM hot cache (heat-tracked, migrating at a capped rate); everything else stays in
ordinary host RAM. On models with skewed routing this beats layer-split offload by
30-100% at the same VRAM budget. The branch also carries
[PR #27742](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/27742) (Qwen3.8-Flash-Next).

**Headline result** — Qwen3.8-Flash-Next (176B total, unsloth UD-Q4_K_XL) with VRAM
**capped to 32GB** (RTX 5090-sized) + 96GB host RAM:

| 32GB-cap config | decode | prefill (4k / 7k) |
|---|---:|---:|
| plain layer-split (`--n-cpu-moe 36`) | 25 tok/s | 421 / 416 t/s |
| **this fork, expert hot cache (`--expert-hot-s 140`)** | **35-36 tok/s (+42%, converged)** | 325 / 320 t/s |

(Figures include the qwen4exp graph-reuse patch, which lifted both configs: baseline
24.2 -> 25, hot cache 32.9 -> 35-36. Earlier figures in the history are pre-reuse.)

**VRAM sweep** (same card ballooned to each size, UD-Q4_K_XL, converged decode):

| VRAM budget | plain layer-split | this fork (hot cache) | gain |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 32 GB (5090-class) | 25 tok/s (`--n-cpu-moe 36`) | **35-36** (`-ehs 140`) | +42% |
| 48 GB | 29 tok/s (`--n-cpu-moe 24`) | **~39** (`-ehs 260`) | +34% |
| 96 GB (no cap) | 88 tok/s (`-ngl 99`, cache not needed) | - | - |

**Minimum-spec demo** - simulated RTX 5090 owner with a normal gaming rig
(32GB VRAM cap + RAM hard-limited to 50GB via cgroup), UD-IQ3_XXS (82GB):
`--cpu-moe --expert-hot-s 260` runs at **~43 tok/s decode** (converged; ~34
cold) with the hot store sized to actually use the card (24GB of the 32GB;
260 of 512 experts resident). llama-bench figures for the same config
(`LLAMA_EHS_HOT_S=260 llama-bench -ot exps=CPU -fa 1`): pp4096 230 t/s,
tg128 37, tg4096 40. RAM stays around 40GB - the n-gram table lives on NVMe
via mmap. IQ3_XXS beats IQ4_XS here: IQ4 experts (~62GB) do not fit a 50GB
RAM budget and thrash to ~15 tok/s after long prompts, so at 50GB RAM use
IQ3_XXS; IQ4_XS wants 64GB+.

Honest caveat: at IQ3 the plain layer-split baseline (`--n-cpu-moe 24`) also
reaches ~42 tok/s - 3-bit experts are small enough that layer offload stops
hurting, so the hot cache buys nothing there. The cache pays off in the 4-bit
tier: Q4_K_XL at a 32GB cap in llama-bench terms is tg4096 26.0 (layer-split)
vs 36.1 (hot cache, +39%; `LLAMA_EHS_HOT_S=140 -ot exps=CPU`), matching the
server-measured 25 -> 35. Pick your quant first, then decide if you need the
cache.


Decode converges over ~10k generated tokens (cold start ~22 tok/s, then 25 -> 30 -> 33 as
the cache adapts at 1 swap/token). The hot cache is a decode optimization: prefill batches
touch nearly all 512 experts, so they bypass the cache and take the plain CPU-offload path -
keep more full layers on the GPU (`--n-cpu-moe`) if prefill matters for your workload.

> **2026-08-27 correction**: the initially published 32.9 figure was measured on a build with

Uncapped on the full 96GB card: llama-bench **tg128 92.7 / pp4096 3115** (branch now based
on upstream master with PR #27742 merged, which adopted graph reuse for qwen4exp - the same
optimization we briefly carried as a port of 0xBakeer's canreuse patch, thanks @0xBakeer).
Server-side decode ~88 tok/s.
Hardware for all numbers: 1x RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Max-Q (300W) + 128GB DDR4 dual-channel.

## Qwen3.8-Flash-Next (125B-A6B + 51B n-gram PLE, unsloth UD-Q4_K_XL 111GB)

| config | VRAM | decode | prefill (7k prompt) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `-ngl 99 --n-cpu-moe 10` | 65 GB | 43.8 tok/s | |
| `-ngl 99 --n-cpu-moe 3` | 76 GB | 60.5 tok/s | |
| **`-ngl 99` (all experts on GPU)** | **80 GB** | **88.1 tok/s** (tg128 90.05) | **~2420 tok/s** |
| VRAM capped to 32GB (64GB balloon) `--n-cpu-moe 36` | ~28 GB | 24.2 tok/s | 421 tok/s |
| VRAM capped to 32GB, **`--cpu-moe --expert-hot-s 140`** (this fork) | ~31 GB | **32.9 tok/s** (converged, see note above) | 325 tok/s |

- The 51B n-gram (PLE) table stays host-resident (~27GB) — its per-token cost is a few KB of
  row gathers, so "table in RAM" is effectively free. This is what makes the model fit.
- The 32GB-cap row simulates an RTX 5090: a physical 64GiB `cudaMalloc` balloon holds the
  memory, so the allocator genuinely has only ~31GB to work with.
- Sampling: official thinking-mode settings (temp 1.0, top-p 0.95). Server flags:
  `-c 8192 -fa on --jinja` (+`-b 2048 -ub 2048` for the prefill run).

## Reproduce (Flash-Next, 32GB-cap result)

```bash
git clone -b expert-tier https://github.com/01554/llama.cpp
cd llama.cpp
cmake -B build -DGGML_CUDA=ON -DLLAMA_BUILD_TESTS=OFF
cmake --build build --config Release -t llama-server -j $(nproc)

# model (111GB)
hf download unsloth/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-GGUF --include "UD-Q4_K_XL/*" --local-dir models
```

Optional - simulate a 32GB card on a bigger one (hold 64GiB in a dummy process):

```c
// balloon.cu - build: nvcc -o balloon balloon.cu ; run: ./balloon 64 &
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <unistd.h>
int main(int c, char **v) { void *p; cudaMalloc(&p, (c>1?atoll(v[1]):64ULL)<<30); for(;;) sleep(3600); }
```

Baseline (plain layer-split offload, ~24 tok/s under the 32GB cap):

```bash
./build/bin/llama-server -m models/UD-Q4_K_XL/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-UD-Q4_K_XL-00001-of-00004.gguf \
  -ngl 99 --n-cpu-moe 36 -c 8192 -fa on --jinja
```

This fork's expert hot cache (~33 tok/s under the same cap):

```bash
LLAMA_EHS_SWAPS_PER_TOK=1 \
./build/bin/llama-server -m models/UD-Q4_K_XL/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-UD-Q4_K_XL-00001-of-00004.gguf \
  -ngl 99 --cpu-moe --expert-hot-s 140 -c 8192 -fa on --jinja
```

Full-VRAM (no cap, 96GB card): drop the balloon and the offload flags, just `-ngl 99` (~75 tok/s).
Host RAM needed for the capped runs: ~96GB (60GB cold experts + 27GB n-gram table).
Sampling for quality checks: temp 1.0, top-p 0.95 (official thinking-mode settings).

## Expert-tier machinery (measured on DeepSeek V4-Flash 0731, UD-Q4_K_XL 155GB)

Single GPU cannot hold the 145GB expert pool; the branch adds:

- `--cpu-moe --expert-hot-s N` (from PR #26563, merged here + fixed): per-expert GPU hot
  store with heat-based migration. **19.8 → 40.3 tok/s** vs plain layer-split offload.
- `LLAMA_EHS_COLD_BANK=1 LLAMA_EHS_B2=1`: **exclusive banks** — every expert lives in exactly
  one place (VRAM hot store or a compact pinned-host cold bank), demotion is a D2H copy,
  no disk in the steady state, host RAM holds only the bank (not a full mmap copy).
  36-37.5 tok/s with full exclusivity; wikitext PPL identical to baseline (3.319 vs 3.324).
- `LLAMA_EHS_SWAPS_PER_TOK=K`: migration-rate cap (churn control).
- `LLAMA_EHS_HEAT_PRIOR=routing.csv`: warm-start expert placement from a measured routing
  profile (see `examples/routing-stats`).
- `examples/routing-stats`: per-layer expert routing histogram / raw-sequence capture tool
  (mind the `ffn_moe_topk` non-contiguous view — this tool reads it correctly).
- mmvq sentinel-skip: cold-bank `mul_mat_id` skips zero-sentinel slots before touching
  weight bytes (tagged via op_params; no effect on stock paths).
- Fixes made along the way: speculative-context hot-store clobber (draft acceptance
  93%→38% bug), `ffn_moe_topk` stride handling, `GGML_CUDA_ALLOW_HOST_BUFT=1` to let
  discrete GPUs compute over pinned host memory (UVA), and more — see commit log.

## Acknowledgements

None of the day-1 numbers here would exist without the [Unsloth](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth)
team: **danielhanchen** authored the qwen4exp llama.cpp support
([PR #27742](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/27742)) that this branch builds on,
and Unsloth shipped the UD-Q4_K_XL dynamic quants of a brand-new 176B architecture within
hours of the model drop. Getting a hybrid-attention + n-gram-PLE + 512-expert model
converted, quantized and running this fast is seriously impressive work.
Thanks also to the Qwen team for designing the PLE table to be offload-friendly in the
first place — and saying so on the model card, which is what made us try it.
